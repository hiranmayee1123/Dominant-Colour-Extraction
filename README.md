Any image consists of pixels, each pixel represents a dot in an image. A pixel contains three values and each value ranges between 0 to 255, representing the amount of red, green and blue components. The combination of these forms an actual color of the pixel. To find the dominant colors, the concept of the k-means clustering is used. One important use of k-means clustering is to segment satellite images to identify surface features.
